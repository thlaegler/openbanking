        # Terminology

          This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization code", "authorization endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client", "client identifier", "client secret", "grant type", "protected resource", "redirection URI", "refresh token", "resource owner", "resource server", "response type", and "token endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and uses the term "Claim" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519].

          * __Account Servicing Payment Services Provider (ASPSP)__ -- An organisation managing customer accounts (and operating banking APIs).
          * __Primary Technical Contact__ -- The person at the TPP who creates an SSA and invokes a registration mechanism. This is an example of an [RFC7591] Client Developer.
          * __OB Organisation ID__ -- The unique identifier for each OpenBanking participant. Both TPPs and ASPSPs have OB Organisation IDs.
          * __OpenBanking Directory__ -- An implementation of a [PSD2] competent authority; acts as an Identity Provider, certificate authority, and registry governing the participants in the UK OpenBanking API scheme.
          * __ASPSP Registration Endpoint__ -- OAuth 2.0 & [RFC7591] compliant endpoint, exact value is discoverable from the [OIDCD] openid-configuration file of the ASPSP.
          * __Software Statement Assertion (SSA)__ -- An implementation of an [RFC7591] software statement, signed by the OpenBanking Directory.
          * __Trusted Third Party (TPP)__ -- An organization working to initiate payments or consume account information with/from an ASPSP.
          * __TPP Client Software__ -- software implementing an OAuth2 client, interacting with an ASPSP registration endpoint.

        # Automated Client Registration

        A TPP MAY use automated client registration to submit an SSA to an ASPSP in exchange for client credentials for use as a client against an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. It is RECOMMENDED for ASPSPs to support the automated client registration mechanism. A large number of claims that OpenID Connect OPs could support as part of the RFC7591 request are detailed [https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata) and should be followed if not explicitly referenced in the Software Statement Assertion claim set.

        ## Request Validation

        Prior to issuing a client registration response, the ASPSP MUST perform the following checks

        * The ASPSP SHOULD check whether the TPP that initiated the TLS connection is the same TPP as listed in the SSA.
        * In the case where a gateway or other piece of infrastructure pre-terminates the MATLS channel in front of the registration endpoint, the certificate used to initiate the connection or some part of that certificate (such as DN & Issuer) SHOULD be made available to the ASPSP for validation against the claims in the SSA.
        * The registration request MUST be signed with a key contained in the JWKS referenced in the SSA included with the request. This ensures that a holder-of-key proof-of-possession is performed proving that the TPP app was the originally intended recipient of the SSA when the OB issued it.
        * The SSA MUST be validated according to [RFC7519], including validation of the signature and validity window.

        JWT signature must be validated, this involves retrieving the jwks keyset for both the OB and the TPP. The OB keystore location will be published as part of the directory specification, The TPP's will be included in the software statement.

        ### SSA Lifetime

        The SSA's Lifetime / Validity period is not defined by Open Banking. ASPSPs in the Open Banking ecosystem are required to implement pragmatic time ranges in which to accept an SSA. For example, an ASPSP that has implemented Dynamic Client Registration may choose to accept SSA's that were issued no earlier than 1 minute prior to their presentation however ASPSPs that only support manual registration may need to accept SSAs that were issued 30 minutes prior as the elapsed time period between generation and use between these two flows is expected to differ significantly.

                                            an account reaches zero. An overdraft
                                            allows the individual to continue withdrawing
                                            money even if the account has no funds
                                            in it or not enough to cover the withdrawal.
                                            Some banking products require an accountholder
                                            to take an Arranged Overdraft(minimum)
                                            of at least GBP X, or else a bank will
                                            not process an Arranged Overdraft request.

                                  Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                  Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                  The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA balance

                                  Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.
                                  2. Tiered
                                  Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.
                                  3. Whole
                                  The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the product holder's account balance

                                        balance. Overall, this means that interest
                                        can be compounded several times in a year
                                        depending on the number of times that interest
                                        payments are made. \n\nRead more: Annual Equivalent

                                  1. Banded
                                  Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                  2. Tiered
                                  Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                  3. Whole
                                  The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA balance

                  Specifies the external purpose code in the format of character string with a maximum length of 4 characters.
                  The list of valid codes is an external code list published separately.

                description: |-
                  Unique reference, as assigned by the creditor, to unambiguously refer to the payment transaction.
                  Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide this reference in the structured remittance information, to enable reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.
                  If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be passed through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction identification.

                                            Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                            2. Tiered
                                            Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                            3. Whole
                                            The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA balance

                                            1. Banded
                                            Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                            2. Tiered
                                            Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                            3. Whole
                                            The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the SME Loan balance

      The payload submitted when a TPP attempts to enrol with an eIDAS QWAC or QSealC certificate. It's format and contents will depend on the value of the `Content-Type` header:  TPP onto the Open Banking Directory (required fields to be validated). For eIDAS QSealC-bearing TPPs use a signed JWT (JWS).

      * __application/json__ -- a JSON payload for QWAC onboarding.
      * __application/jwt__ -- a signed JWT (JWS) for QSealC onboarding.
      * __application/jose__ -- same as __application/jwt__.

      ## QWAC-based Onboarding

      Set `Content-Type` to `application/json` and send the payload conforming to the schema.

        ],
        "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg": "string"
      }
      ```

      ## QSealC-based Onboarding

      Set `Content-Type` to `application/jwt` or `application/jose` and send the payload conforming to the schema as a signed JWT.

      The QSealC, the issuing certificate, and the root certificate (all in DER format) must be used as the items of the array, which forms the value of the `x5c` claim in the JWT header.

      The JWT MUST be signed using the private key associated with the QSealC listed in the `x5c` claim in the header.

      ```
