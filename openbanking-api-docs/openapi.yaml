      requestBody:
        description: |
          The payload submitted when a TPP attempts to enrol with an eIDAS QWAC or QSealC certificate. It's format and contents will depend on the value of the `Content-Type` header:  TPP onto the Open Banking Directory (required fields to be validated). For eIDAS QSealC-bearing TPPs use a signed JWT (JWS).

          * __application/json__ -- a JSON payload for QWAC onboarding.
          * __application/jwt__ -- a signed JWT (JWS) for QSealC onboarding.
          * __application/jose__ -- same as __application/jwt__.

          ## QWAC-based Onboarding

          Set `Content-Type` to `application/json` and send the payload conforming to the schema.

          EXAMPLE REQUEST PAYLOAD FOR QWAC-BASED ONBOARDING

          ```
          POST /organisation/tpp HTTP/1.1
          Content-Type: application/json
          Accept: application/json
          Host: matls-dirapi.openbanking.org.uk
          {
            "client_name": "string",
            "scope": "string",
            "token_endpoint_auth_method": "string",
            "tls_client_auth_subject_dn": "string",
            "grant_types": [
              "string"
            ],
            "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg": "string"
          }
          ```

          ## QSealC-based Onboarding

          Set `Content-Type` to `application/jwt` or `application/jose` and send the payload conforming to the schema as a signed JWT.

          The QSealC, the issuing certificate, and the root certificate (all in DER format) must be used as the items of the array, which forms the value of the `x5c` claim in the JWT header.

          The JWT MUST be signed using the private key associated with the QSealC listed in the `x5c` claim in the header.

          ```
          {
            "typ": "JWT",
            "alg": "ES256",
            "kid": "ABCD1234",
            "x5c": ["qsealc", "issuer certificate", "root certificate"]
          }
          {
            "client_name": "string",
            "scope": "string",
            "token_endpoint_auth_method": "string",
            "tls_client_auth_subject_dn": "string",
            "grant_types": [
              "string"
            ],

          * __PEM file__ -- when the request `Content-Type` header is set to  `application/x-pem-file` the contents of the PEM file will differ depending upon `OrganisationCertificateType`. If `OrganisationCertificateType` is set to `qwac`, `qseal` then the PEM file should contain a *QWAC* or a *QSEAL* certificate respectively; if `OrganisationCertificateType` is set to `obwac` or `obseal` then the PEM file should contain a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for an OB-issued *OBWAC* or *OBSEAL* certificate respectively.
          * __Signed JWT__ -- when the request `Content-Type` header is set to `application/jwt` the body of the signed JWT will contain a CSR or a certificate.

          ### Requesting a Certificate using a signed JWT

          The header `kid` claim is the ID of the QSealC certificate assigned to it by the OB JWKS store.

          The body `csr` claim is the CSR in the DER format.

          ```
          {
            "typ": "JWT",
            "alg": "ES256",
            "kid": "ABCD1234",
          }
          {
            "csr": "string"
          }
          ```

          ### Uploaing a Certificate using a signed JWT

          The header `kid` claim is the ID of the QSealC certificate assigned to it by the OB JWKS store.

          The body `x5c` claim is the array of certificate, issuer certificate, and root certificate in the DER format.

          ```
          {
            "typ": "JWT",
            "alg": "ES256",
            "kid": "ABCD1234",
          }
          {
            "x5c": ["qsealc", "issuer certificate", "root certificate"]
          }
          ```

        The response body is a signed JWT and the values found in the header and the payload of the SSA are specified below

        # Terminology

          This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization code", "authorization endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client", "client identifier", "client secret", "grant type", "protected resource", "redirection URI", "refresh token", "resource owner", "resource server", "response type", and "token endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and uses the term "Claim" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519].

          * __Account Servicing Payment Services Provider (ASPSP)__ -- An organisation managing customer accounts (and operating banking APIs).
          * __Primary Technical Contact__ -- The person at the TPP who creates an SSA and invokes a registration mechanism. This is an example of an [RFC7591] Client Developer.
          * __OB Organisation ID__ -- The unique identifier for each OpenBanking participant. Both TPPs and ASPSPs have OB Organisation IDs.
          * __OpenBanking Directory__ -- An implementation of a [PSD2] competent authority; acts as an Identity Provider, certificate authority, and registry governing the participants in the UK OpenBanking API scheme.
          * __ASPSP Registration Endpoint__ -- OAuth 2.0 & [RFC7591] compliant endpoint, exact value is discoverable from the [OIDCD] openid-configuration file of the ASPSP.
          * __Software Statement Assertion (SSA)__ -- An implementation of an [RFC7591] software statement, signed by the OpenBanking Directory.
          * __Trusted Third Party (TPP)__ -- An organization working to initiate payments or consume account information with/from an ASPSP.
          * __TPP Client Software__ -- software implementing an OAuth2 client, interacting with an ASPSP registration endpoint.

        # Software Statement Assertion (SSA)

          The SSA is a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing client metadata about an instance of TPP client software. The JWT is issued and signed by the OpenBanking Directory.

        ## SSA Payload

          The payload of an OpenBanking SSA MUST be a compliant software statement according to [RFC7591]. The SSA MUST also be a compliant JWT according to [RFC7519]. The following metadata profiles the metadata in [RFC7591] and [RFC7519]:

          | Metadata | Description | Source Specification |

        # Automated Client Registration

        A TPP MAY use automated client registration to submit an SSA to an ASPSP in exchange for client credentials for use as a client against an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. It is RECOMMENDED for ASPSPs to support the automated client registration mechanism. A large number of claims that OpenID Connect OPs could support as part of the RFC7591 request are detailed [https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata) and should be followed if not explicitly referenced in the Software Statement Assertion claim set.

        ## Request Validation

        Prior to issuing a client registration response, the ASPSP MUST perform the following checks

        * The ASPSP SHOULD check whether the TPP that initiated the TLS connection is the same TPP as listed in the SSA.
        * In the case where a gateway or other piece of infrastructure pre-terminates the MATLS channel in front of the registration endpoint, the certificate used to initiate the connection or some part of that certificate (such as DN & Issuer) SHOULD be made available to the ASPSP for validation against the claims in the SSA.
        * The registration request MUST be signed with a key contained in the JWKS referenced in the SSA included with the request. This ensures that a holder-of-key proof-of-possession is performed proving that the TPP app was the originally intended recipient of the SSA when the OB issued it.
        * The SSA MUST be validated according to [RFC7519], including validation of the signature and validity window.

        JWT signature must be validated, this involves retrieving the jwks keyset for both the OB and the TPP. The OB keystore location will be published as part of the directory specification, The TPP's will be included in the software statement.

        ### SSA Lifetime

        The SSA's Lifetime / Validity period is not defined by Open Banking. ASPSPs in the Open Banking ecosystem are required to implement pragmatic time ranges in which to accept an SSA. For example, an ASPSP that has implemented Dynamic Client Registration may choose to accept SSA's that were issued no earlier than 1 minute prior to their presentation however ASPSPs that only support manual registration may need to accept SSAs that were issued 30 minutes prior as the elapsed time period between generation and use between these two flows is expected to differ significantly.

                                              allows the individual to continue withdrawing

                                              Some banking products require an accountholder

                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                    3. Whole
                                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA balance

                                    1. Banded
                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.
                                    2. Tiered
                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.
                                    3. Whole
                                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the product holder's account balance

                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                    2. Tiered
                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                    3. Whole
                                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA balance

                                              1. Banded
                                              Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                              2. Tiered
                                              Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                              3. Whole
                                              The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA balance

        ```
        {
          "typ": "JWT",
          "alg": "ES256",
          "kid": "ABCD1234",

    Enrol:
      description: |
        The payload submitted when a TPP attempts to enrol with an eIDAS QWAC or QSealC certificate. It's format and contents will depend on the value of the `Content-Type` header:  TPP onto the Open Banking Directory (required fields to be validated). For eIDAS QSealC-bearing TPPs use a signed JWT (JWS).

        * __application/json__ -- a JSON payload for QWAC onboarding.
        * __application/jwt__ -- a signed JWT (JWS) for QSealC onboarding.
        * __application/jose__ -- same as __application/jwt__.

        ## QWAC-based Onboarding

        Set `Content-Type` to `application/json` and send the payload conforming to the schema.

        EXAMPLE REQUEST PAYLOAD FOR QWAC-BASED ONBOARDING

        ```
        POST /organisation/tpp HTTP/1.1
        Content-Type: application/json
        Accept: application/json
        Host: matls-dirapi.openbanking.org.uk
        {
          "client_name": "string",

          "grant_types": [

          ],
          "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg": "string"
        }
        ```

        ## QSealC-based Onboarding

        Set `Content-Type` to `application/jwt` or `application/jose` and send the payload conforming to the schema as a signed JWT.

        The QSealC, the issuing certificate, and the root certificate (all in DER format) must be used as the items of the array, which forms the value of the `x5c` claim in the JWT header.

        The JWT MUST be signed using the private key associated with the QSealC listed in the `x5c` claim in the header.

        ```
        {
          "typ": "JWT",
          "alg": "ES256",
          "kid": "ABCD1234",
          "x5c": ["qsealc", "issuer certificate", "root certificate"]
        }
        {
          "client_name": "string",
          "scope": "string",
          "token_endpoint_auth_method": "string",
          "tls_client_auth_subject_dn": "string",
